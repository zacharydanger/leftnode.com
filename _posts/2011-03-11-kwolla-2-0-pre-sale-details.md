We're pleased to announce the Kwolla 2.0 Pre-Sale event starting today, March 11, 2011 on [kwolla.com](http://kwolla.com/)! Releasing Kwolla 2.0 is right around the corner and we want to give our customers a chance to pre-order version 2.0 and get a few goodies in the process.

First, if you are an Initial Adopter, you don't need to purchase any new versions of Kwolla - ever. You'll get free lifetime upgrades.

If you want to support the development of Kwolla, join the Initial Adopters program, and get a lot of free goodies, then the Kwolla 2.0 pre-sale is precisely for you!

### Initial Adopters
Initial Adopters are people who have purchased Kwolla 1.x in the past or people who purchase Kwolla 2.0 during the pre-sale. The biggest benefit to being an Initial Adopter is receiving lifetime upgrades of Kwolla software and modules published by Leftnode **for FREE**.

Purchasing a copy of Kwolla 2.0 during the pre-sale will automatically add you to the Initial Adopters list. We are ending the Initial Adopters program when Kwolla 2.0 is released, so if you want to join at an all time low price, now is the time to do it.

### Kwolla 2.0 Pre-Sale

Additionally, being a part of the Kwolla 2.0 development cycle will allow you to give us your insight into what will make a great product for your network.

### New Kwolla 2.0 Features
Kwolla 2.0 comes with many new features. One of the nicest new features of Kwolla 2.0 is the totally rewritten module architecture. Modules can now be enabled and disabled easily and can seamlessly work with each other.

+  Events - members can also create public or private events such as birthday parties, charity dinners, or just a drink after work at the pub.
+  API driven design - everything in Kwolla 2.0 is built on an API that lets you build your own Kwolla modules. The API also makes scalability incredibly simple.
+  Redesigned Activity Feed - the Activity Feed is the heart of your social network, and members can share videos, photos, links, comments, or music easily with it.
