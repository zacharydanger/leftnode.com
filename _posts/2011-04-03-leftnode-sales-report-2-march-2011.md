A little over a month ago I published the results of my [first month of Kwolla sales](/entry/leftnode-sales-report-1-february-2011.html). I decided to wait a bit longer to do this months sales report so rather than doing it on the 17th of each month, I will do it around the 1st. It makes it easier for everyone.

As you might be aware, on March 4th I made Kwolla 1.x free to download and use on your server. I still have not made it open source, but I have plans on doing that this week. This report will include both how much money Leftnode Software has made since March 1st, and how many Kwolla downloads have been made.

Also during this time, I decided to start selling the Kwolla 2.0 Pre-Sale Package. The Pre-Sale Package saves you over $350, so if you are interested in using Kwolla, I suggest you start with 1.x and then take advantage of the Kwolla 2.0 Pre-Sale Package.

### The Paid Numbers
Since making Kwolla 1.x free and starting the 2.0 pre-sale, Leftnode Software made **$766.95 in revenue**. After PayPal took their cut, Leftnode was **left with $728.60**. In that time, we **spent $50 in advertising on BuySellAds**. Also during that time, StumbleUpon launched a new advertising platform. Because we had advertised through the StumbleUpon platform before, we were given **$200 in free advertising**. While StumbleUpon is not the best source of quality traffic, it did keep a steady stream of users coming to [kwolla.com](http://kwolla.com) which always helps increase download numbers.

I sincerely thank everyone who has decided to either purchase Premium Support or purchase the Kwolla 2.0 Pre-Sale Package. You are really helping my dreams of being an independent software developer come true, and it is very appreciated.

### The Free Numbers
The response to making Kwolla 1.x free has been nothing short of amazing. At the time of this writing, there are **684 unique orders** for Kwolla 1.x and it has been **downloaded 866 times**. Each download link is valid for up to 6 downloads. Some customers download it multiple times with their download link or they share the link with their friends. The kwolla.com website has served **1234 total downloads**, which includes the free sample code.

Although the download for Kwolla 1.x is free, I consider it an "order" because it is handled the exact same way as a paid purchase, with the exception the customer does not have to go to PayPal to complete the transaction.

Our site has served **14962 unique views** and **31073 page views**. The ten most popular URLs in descending order are:

+  /
+  /product/kwolla-presale
+  /product/kwolla-social-network
+  /cart
+  /product/kwolla-social-network/downloads
+  /product/kwolla-social-network/screenshots
+  /product/kwolla-social-network/features
+  /store
+  /store/free-downloads
+  /product/kwolla-social-network/hosts

I was surprised to see that the Kwolla 2.0 Pre-Sale Package page received more views than the Kwolla 1.x Social Network page, but my stats showed that we did a targeted StumbleUpon advertising campaign directly to the pre-sale URL.

Leftnode Software has some very exciting news to announce in the upcoming month both with a partnership and a new product. As a final note: purchasing a Kwolla 2.0 Pre-Sale Package gives you special access to the development server so you can watch as Kwolla 2.0 is built.

Thank you again for your support and enthusiasm with Kwolla. I sincerely appreciate it.
