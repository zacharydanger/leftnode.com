While I have been developing software and being paid for it since 1999, I did not really start *developing software* until around 2003 or so. I was comfortable enough at that point to build large scale Internet applications.
It has not been until recently (within the past three to four years) that I have really grown as a developer. I want to share that growth with you in a new series I am writing.

I spend a lot of time writing about PHP and PHP developers have been given a bum rap lately. Any competent PHP developer knows it is not a well designed language. Compared to Ruby, Python, Scala, Java, and many others,
PHP is pretty low on the list of well designed languages. I think a lot of criticism comes from incompetent PHP developers doing things in it because it is the path of least reistence.

Be that as it may, there is no reason why PHP developers can not be competent developers in a bad ecosystem (admittedly, it has improved dramatically).

I am going to start a series called *Effective Developer Tactics* on this site. The series will not be aimed at any specific type of developer, but rather will give you key tips on ways you can improve your code without much effort.
My goal is to keep the series as language agnostic as possible. Examples will mostly be in PHP (which is a breeze to read if you are completely unfamiliar with the language), but I will do my best to inject examples in other languages
(it will provide me a good opportunity to toy around with them as well).

Some topics will cover:

* Immutable objects
* Single responsibility method
* Clean code
* Refactorings
* Domain Specific APIs
* Different types of testing

My goal is to publish at least one lesson per week. If you are interested in a series like this, please take a moment to register for my email newsletter or [subscribe to my site](/feed.xml).
