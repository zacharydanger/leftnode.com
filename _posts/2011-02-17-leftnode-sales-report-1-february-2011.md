The Kwolla Social Network software was officially launched on January 15, 2011 and now that a month has passed, I want to do a sales report. I plan on doing these monthly because of my desire to build an open software company.

After launching, I received some initial feedback that the [kwolla.com](http://kwolla.com) website was poorly constructed and clumsily laid out. I launched a new version of the website on January 17, 2011 and it remains the current site at the time of this article's publication.

Launching a piece of commercial software has been a dream since I started learning software development in 1999, and the way Kwolla has taken off is astounding me.

### Initial Worries
Every developer releasing a piece of software thinks it's awesome. "Who wouldn't want to buy this?" they say. "My price point is low enough, I have a nice website, it's full of features, I'll sell a thousand copies in a few short days." Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way unless you have a tremendous amount of clout within a community, are already famous elsewhere, or have done a tremendous amount of pre-sale marketing. I had none of those, so I was literally starting at ground zero.

I launched the website and was able to promote on Reddit and Hacker News which always gets some initial traffic. Rarely does it sustain past a day or two. However, I thought that would bring in at least one order on the first day. *Nope, not one.* And thus begins the worries: "Is my site functioning?", "My checkout process, does it work?", "Is PayPal down? PayPal must be down, thats why!" Unfortunately it's not, PayPal is not down. **It took six days before my first order came in.**

The customer came from Hacker News which was great. They purchased a copy and everything worked flawlessly through the checkout process. To say I was elated would be an understatement. Here I was, in Dallas, TX selling a piece of software I wrote to someone across the world and I had no part in the transaction process. It was an amazing feeling to know someone trusted you enough to purchase your software. It still is humbling.

After my first sale, I knew this was viable. There's developers clamoring for a nice piece of social networking software, and I think Kwolla is a great, low cost introduction to building your own social site. To help sales, I created a Lite version of the software with less features and released it on CodeCanyon.net. This has helped boost Kwolla Full sales as well.

### The Raw Numbers
At the time of this articles publication, there have been 14 sales of Kwolla Full, 15 sales of Kwolla Lite, and 5 hours of Premium Support purchased for a revenue total of **$1388.20**. Total profit after all fees is **$1003.88**. CodeCanyon takes a whopping 75% because I opted to not be an exclusive author.

My first point of business after making several sales was to have a professional designer (and good friend) redesign the kwolla.com website. The new design is finished, but I'm holding off on launching it until Kwolla 1.2.0 is released. I also paid to have some banners made from [RightBanners](http://rightbanners.com).

I've invested in some advertising as well: StumbleUpon Ads, Google AdWords, Facebook Ads, Hotscripts.com Advertising, PHPKode.com, and BuySellAds.com. Without a doubt, BuySellAds.com has provided the best click through rate (nearly 1%). StumbleUpon is great if you want raw traffic, but there's absolutely no stickiness. I can't afford to do a huge Google or Facebook AdWords campaign yet, so they're not performing well either. When Kwolla 1.2.0 launches, I'll advertise on several BuySellAds.com networks.

### Pricing
When Kwolla first launched, I had it priced at $149. Everyone said it was too expensive given the featureset combined with the newness of the product. I dropped the price to $79 with a 20% off coupon. This price point is where I got my first sales.

After sales slowed, I dropped the price dramatically to $29.99 (but took away the auto discount code) as I'm interested as getting as many developers on board with the Initial Adopters program. The Initial Adopters program is for all customers who purchase Kwolla during it's launch phase. Initial Adopters get a free installation and free lifetime updates of the software and all modules released by Leftnode Software. I think $29.99 is a very good price given the feature set and it allows you to automatically join the Initial Adopters program.

Kwolla 1.2.0 is currently under development. It includes many new features like a [full RESTful API](/entry/kwolla-1.2.0-architecture) and [GUI Installation](/entry/kwolla-1.2.0-gui-installation-process). Of course, as a result of the Initial Adopters program, all purchasers of Kwolla 1.1.0 get a free upgrade to 1.2.0.

Thank you again for all of the support and look forward for the 1.2.0 release!
