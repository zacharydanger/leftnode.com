**This entry is no longer valid; Kwolla 1.2.0 has been renamed to Kwolla 2.0.** I'm delaying the launch of Kwolla 1.2.0 until I can get the new features outlined in the preview below finished. I'll make a better estimated roadmap after the new kwolla.com launches and I can then go back to devoting all of my time to Kwolla 1.2.0. I apologize for the disappointment, but 1.2.0 will be here soon.

Below is a new layout of what the homepage/profile page will look like. The amazing design was done by my good friend Neil Duffy.

On the left hand side of the homepage, your Kwolla installation will be configurable in what it displays. By default it will display the login and registration buttons, number of online members, and some sitewide stats. The main column column is a listing of all (public) activity around the site. Anytime someone posts a comment, photo, video, link, or audio file, the Activity Feed will pick it up and make it simple to see what your friends are up to.

The difference between the homepage and the profile is the homepage won't allow people to comment, and the profile will only show activities from your friends.

I spent this weekend working on the new kwolla.com which will launch later this week. Development for Kwolla 1.2.0 will continue after that.

Now is the time to [purchase Kwolla 1.1.0](https://kwolla.com/cart) to join the Initial Adopters program.
