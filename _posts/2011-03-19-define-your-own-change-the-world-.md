I just finished reading *The Art of the Start* by Guy Kawasaki. It is a good book and a fast read; I suggest you pick up a copy and read it yourself. In the book, Kawasaki claims that one thing a startup should do is "change the world". That phrase is incredibly frightening: what if the startup you're working on won't "change the world"? It took me a while to understand what that means: define your own meaning of change the world.

That phrase, "change the world", is thrown around frequently in the startup and hacker community. For a young entrepreneur, it's incredibly frightening. "What if my startup doesn't change the world? Can I be successful if my startup doesn't change the world? What does it mean to change the world?"

When I finally realized to define my own meaning for change the world, it immediately had a powerful and profound impact on how I approach my work. I had my own feelings of inadequacy when I launched my software. Will my software, <a href="http://kwolla.com">Kwolla</a>, change the world? Will it be the next Google or Facebook which has changed the world in a profound way? Probably not. So I needed to define what my own version of "change the world" means.

Because Kwolla actually started from the ashes of a failed startup, it didn't have a grandiose "change the world" idea behind it. Essentially, it was, "lets see if we can make some money off this software." Now that it has been downloaded nearly 1000 times, it's time to define what "change the world" means to me.

I'm changing the world because I've written a piece of software that allows people to build their own online communities easily. It allows universities, businesses, bands, and groups of people to congregate online and communicate. Kwolla has influenced their world, and thats how I've defined my version of "change the world": to positively influence someones life through my software.

If the feedback I've received from the nearly 1000 downloads of Kwolla is any indication, I'm already on my way of positively influencing someone elses life.

If you're worried that your startup isn't world changing, I challenge you to define what "change the world" means for you. After you do, get back to building your world changing startup.
