I am excited to announce that Kwolla 1.1.3 has officially been released. Like the other 1.x series, 1.1.3 is free to download and use.

### Changelog
+  **Updated Photo Album** &mdash; You can now manage your photo album better by deleting photos and swapping out your current photos with previous ones.
+  **Cleaner Theme** &mdash; The header has been cleaned up by putting the static links in the footer and putting the language dropdown in the main menu. The search bar was also moved to the Account menu.
+  **Modules** &mdash; Kwolla 1.1.3 brings an actual module system to the codebase. Modules can now be installed with ease. The first module, Forums, is due to be released within a day of this post.
+  **Private Message Layout Updated** &mdash; The listing of your private messages was updated to use the standard table layout.
+  **Admin Panel** &mdash; A very basic admin panel has been added. Right now you can't do much with it except manage the Forums if you have that module enabled.

Overall, I'm incredibly happy with the 1.1.3 release. Our [own social network](http://social.kwolla.com) has been updated and is working very well. I encourage you to download Kwolla 1.1.3 and start your own social network today.
