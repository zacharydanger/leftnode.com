I started programming with PHP in 1999 when it was PHP3. I've made my living with it one way or another in the last 12 years, so I consider myself pretty proficient with it.

PHP is not liked by many people, sometimes with good reason and sometimes not. Regardless, it is here to stay. It has been called the COBOL of the Internet. [In 2038](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) programmers are going to make a lot of money updating MySQL databases to use bigint fields for Unix timestamps.

Because PHP is here to stay, there needs to be some great material for established and neophyte PHP developers. We want new developers learning the best possible practices now (and not from w3schools.com), and we want established developers on top of best practices now.

I want to know if there is interest in a book on developing enterprise PHP applications. Some possible topics include:

  * Basics of MVC
  * When to use a framework and when not to
  * Repository organization
  * Working with a team of developers
  * Building a scalable system
  * Release management (continuous integration, automated builds, version control)
  * Unit Testing and developing with TDD
  * When to use PHP and when not to
  * Building a script server with PHP
  * Maintaining old PHP software

Each of these could probably take up a book in their own right, so perhaps the book would be released serially. I picture the book being given away online as free, and available to purchase as a PDF download or as a printed copy.

However, before I pursue such an endeavor, I want to know if there is sufficient interest. If you're interested, please email me <vmc@leftnode.com> with your ideas.
