In between the last 1.1.0 Kwolla launch and 1.2.0, I wanted to make some updates to Kwolla 1.1.0 that makes it more usable. These should be available by Friday, and all current purchasers will get an email when Kwolla 1.1.1 launches should they decide to upgrade.

Kwolla 1.1.1 contains several new features:

+  A basic photo album that stores all of your past uploaded images
+  A more in depth activity stream so you can like and comment on friends activity updates
+  Your activities displayed on your public profile
+  Reformatting of the Control Panel to make it two columns rather than three
+  Fixed a bug with the image uploader so JPG, GIF, and PNG (transparent as well) images are uploaded properly
+  Much easier installation. All files are located in a single directory now
+  Much better installation documentation with detailed steps on how to install Kwolla through cPanel

I'm releasing two preview screenshots to show a mock of the updated Activity Feed and Photo Album. The Activity Feed displays you and your friends status updates, photo updates, comments made, friendships made, and video uploads. You can now choose to "Like" one of the feed items, or make a direct comment on it.

The next screenshot shows what the basic Photo Album will look like. It will display all of a members uploaded photos. Below each photo, a member will see when the photo was uploaded and if is current. If a photo is not a members current profile photo, they can make it current with a single click. It's a simple album, but the basis of a very strong module.

A link to a members photo album will also be present on their public profile.

I'm planning on finishing up this release today and then testing it extensively. I'm looking for a launch tomorrow or over the weekend at the latest. Current customers enrolled in the Initial Adopters program will get a free update. You can join the Initial Adopters program now by [buying a license of Kwolla](http://kwolla.com).
