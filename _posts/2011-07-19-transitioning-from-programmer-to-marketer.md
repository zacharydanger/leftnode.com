**Note:** This is the second part in a two part series I'm writing about my experiences with selling software online. You should start by reading [Lessons I Have Learned From Selling Software Online](/entry/lessons-i-have-learned-from-selling-software-online) if you have not.

Your software is finished and ready to be sold. Now what? As I mentioned in my previous article, I am basing my information in this one on only a few months of experience. It is in those few months that I transitioned from a programmer to a marketer, and here is what I did.

I think a lot of programmers are adverse to marketing because it is done wrong so often. Everywhere you see sleazy, unethical, and immoral examples of marketing. Marketing that is asking people to buy things they do not need with money they do not have. As a programmer, I have that uneasy feeling about marketing often as well.

They key is to learn how to do respectful marketing. Seth Godin calls this *permission marketing*. Ask for potential customers permission to market to them. Do not bombard them with useless advertisements and reasons they need your product when they do not. You will feel much better when someone purchases your product because they **really** want it, and not because they almost feel obligated to.

### Everything is Marketing
If you ever plan on being an independent software vendor or entrepreneur, you are going to have to convert potential customers into paying customers. That process is called marketing. It involves the incredibly awkward and difficult task of asking for money. When money changes hands, expectations change.

Once your software is released, **everything** you do is marketing, whether it is related to your business or not. Everything from how you act on your Twitter and Facebook accounts to your customer support to your website is marketing. Act like a jerk on Twitter? It will reflect poorly on your business. Give absolutely great support? You are marketing your business as one that gives outstanding service. Your customer support becomes your marketing.

### SEO Marketing
Search Engine Optimization is one of the most natural ways to market your new product. SEO is time consuming and labor intensive. To be competitive, you really have to invest a lot of time to building great content. Generally, I believe good SEO comes down to two things: create good content and have other high profile websites link to you.

[Patrick McKenzie](http://www.kalzumeus.com) has had the best advice for simple SEO I have heard to date: find pain points for Google's search results, and fix them with your content. Pick a query relating to your product and look at the Search Engine Results Page (SERP). If the SERP is full of links to ehow.com or wikihow.com or answers.com (or any other Demand Media or content generation company), that is really Google begging you to create good content for them to replace those links.

The next step is to write that content and link to it on your website. I did that with Kwolla (I only wrote a few pages) and the results were amazing. My most successful page is [Social Networking for Programmers](http://kwolla.com/page/social-networking-for-programmers) which shows up for a query like "how to create a social network for programmers". Keep the quality of the content legitimate and you will rank highly soon. This is obviously a much cheaper and longer lasting endeavor than paid advertising.

### Paid Advertising
Spending money on paid advertising is another great way to market your new product. Many people are AdWords geniuses and can use Google's service with ease. I am not one of those people. I simply have not spent the time necessary to learn how to use AdWords to my advantage. Every time I put money into it, it evaporates faster than an ice cube in a Texas summer.

I prefer to find smaller blogs and websites where I can control what ads are displayed and can build a relationship with the site owner. You can find blogs to advertise by contacting the owner of your favorite sites, or by using the service [BuySellAds](http://www.buysellads.com) (BSA). With BSA, you upload the ads you display on the sites you want. No bidding, no keywords, just dead simple advertising. It is a great service for a small fish like myself who would not be invited to join a premium ad network like The Deck.

Site owners often contact you on their own. Ask if you can write an article for their site or if there is another way to cross promote your products.

### Social Media
There is a fine line between telling your followers or friends about your product, and pushing it down their throats. Legitimate followers will soon unfollow you, and your remaining followers are not likely to be your customers. If you have a large social presence, use it to your advantage to tell your followers how your product can help them. Or you can give them freebies related to your product. Or you can give them faster support. Give customers an incentive to follow you on Twitter after they have made a purchase.

These are several ways you can sell your product through social media without sounding like a sleazy marketer.

### Subtle Marketing
You are most effective as a marketer when you are not doing it at all.

#### Community Asset
I am only mentioning him again because fits this description well, but Patrick McKenzie is a prime example of an excellent community asset in the Hacker News community. Registered as `patio11`, he is widely known for the piles of free advice he's dispensed as he has transitioned from programmer to marketer. There is no doubt that this influence over the community has helped sales (my wife is a teacher and I have told her about [BingoCardCreator](http://www.bingocardcreator.com)).

#### Community Producer
In addition to being a community asset, creating free products for the betterment of the community is a wonderful way to market. The [poster children](http://37signals.com) for this method of marketing released Ruby on Rails.

#### Beauty
I had trouble finding a word for this category, but *beauty* fits well. The financial management website Mint.com released dozens of **stunningly beautiful** infographics about money. Each one had a watermarked logo and it no doubt caused people to use them over Wesabe. Beautiful infographics get shared on every large news aggregator.

This is an example of marketing that requires extreme talent. I am not a graphic designer, and there is no way I could create an infographic that would not be laughed at.

#### yourproduct.com
The last example of subtle marketing is your website. Once you have the money, spend it to have an actual designer build your site. The difference between it and a $20 ThemeForest theme is stunning. I get compliments on [kwolla.com](http://kwolla.com) all the time. I started off with a ThemeForest theme, and soon hired my friend Neil to redesign it. ThemeForest themes are often horribly coded and very inefficient.

A gorgeous website tells your customers you are serious about your product and willing to invest in yourself.

### Continual Marketing
Finally, you must continually market to your existing customer base &mdash; do not forget about them! Marketing to gain new customers is important, but you need to keep your current customers in loop with the progression of your software.
