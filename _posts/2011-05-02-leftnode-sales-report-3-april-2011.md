The end of April marks another month for Leftnode Software and it also means it is time for another revenue and web analytics report. Compared to February and March, I did not bring in as much money in April.

I finally decided to add the money I made through CodeCanyon.net into our PayPal coffers. After they take out their very large percentage (70%), I was left with $77.50. April was a very dry month regarding premium support and Kwolla 2.0 pre-sales. Here's the overall breakdown:

### Revenue
+  **+$278.00** &mdash; Two Kwolla 2.0 pre-sale packages were sold. These came in the last few days and I was very relieved to get the sales. I can not express how powerful of a feeling it is to bring in revenue for an unreleased product. I truly appreciate the support I've received, both monetarily and emotionally.
+  **+$77.50** &mdash; While I counted this revenue in February, I transferred it to my PayPal account in April.
+  **-$400.00** &mdash; I paid myself $400 for a new laptop.
+  **-$100.00** &mdash; I paid my friend, business partner, and graphic designer Neil $100.00 to work on a mockup of the new kwolla.com homepage for an upcoming product.
+  **-$49.99** &mdash; I put out a paid ad on [sitepointmarket.com](http://sitepointmarket.com) that initially resulted in a lot of downloads, but petered off quickly after a few days.

I did not re-up any of my paid advertising on BuySellAds due to poor performance. I'll consider this avenue in the future, but for now I'd rather not spend my money on advertising.

At the end of the month, I have **$100.00** in my actual business bank account and **$613.12** in my PayPal account. While overall work was down in April, I managed to get a tremendous amount of work done on Kwolla 2.0. Additionally, I plan on announcing a new version of Kwolla 1.x on Tuesday May 3rd, 2011, along with a new module available to purchase (free to all Initial Adopters).

### Web Analytics
April brought some good web traffic and analytics, but less than March's numbers. Below are April's numbers with March's numbers in parentheses.

+  **10571 (13964, -24%)** &mdash; Number of unique visits for April 2011. This was a decrease of **24 percent** from the previous month.
+  **22282 (29089, -23%)** &mdash; Number of total visits for April 2011. This was a decrease of **23 percent** from the previous month.
+  **348 (674, -48%)** &mdash; The number of converted shopping carts where a conversion counts as either a free download or a paid purchase. This was a decrease of **48 percent** from the previous month.
+  **36% (41%, -12%)** &mdash; The cart conversaton rate for April 2011. This was a decrease of **12 percent** from the previous month.

One of the most important numbers, the cart conversion rate, has not dropped dramatically as the rest of the numbers. Still, it's obvious some changes need to be made to increase revenue, traffic, and conversions.

### Actionable SEO Advice
One day I received an email from AppSumo regarding a free lecture from SEO expert Patrick McKenzie. It had the first piece of actionable SEO advice I've heard since "make good content people link to." Essentially, he said do a Google search for keywords that pair well with your product. If you find that the search results page is filled with content scrapers like eHow and wikiHow then Google is just looking for good original content for those pages. Essentially, those results are only placeholders because no one else has written good content for those keywords. He demoed a system he has written for his product [Bingo Card Creator](http://www.bingocardcreator.com/) that allows freelancers to create good content pages relating his product to certain keywords.

This was pretty eye opening. For too long I had been using highly ranked keywords associated with pages that had no chance of being replaced by my new low PageRank website. After I watched that, I immediately implemented a similar system on kwolla.com with different pages of content (his system was done in Ruby on Rails and mine is in PHP). Each of these pages has a form that allows someone to download Kwolla 1.x. Each of those downloads are tracked as coming from that content page. I'm very happy with this system so far and someday plan on releasing the code behind kwolla.com.

### Conclusion
While it is disheartening to see revenue and web traffic decrease, I'm staying positive because [Startups Are Hard](http://blog.jazzychad.net/2011/05/02/startups-are-hard.html) and I'm trying to do this on a shoestring budget while maintaining a fulltime job. Things will get better. Kwolla 1.1.3 with a new module is right around the corner and Kwolla 2.0 will be here before you know it. I do suggest you download Kwolla 1.x for free and if you feel you have a need for a much nicer version to seriously consider purchasing a pre-sale license of Kwolla 2.0.
