**Note:** This is the first part in a two part series I'm writing about my experiences with selling software online.

I was talking to [another programmer](http://www.vancelucas.com/) the other day, and he wanted my thoughts on how to sell downloadable software. He is getting ready to start selling [his chat software](http://kikuchat.com/), so we talked shortly over Skype. I'm not an Internet millionaire, I've never sold a company, I've never taken venture capital, and I still have a job where I work for someone else. I'm new to this, but I still think I can share some valuable advice. I also have no experience selling any type of Software-as-a-Service product; this applies only to software you purchase and download.

I started selling the [PHP social network software Kwolla](http://kwolla.com) back in January 2011. It was my first venture into selling downloadable software. A social network I built with some friends went nowhere (we had a great time making it), so we decided "the codebase is still fine, why not try to sell it and see what happens?" Thus, Kwolla was born.

Within five days, I had my first sale. It was an incredibly gratifying and satisfying feeling, and one I hope every entrepreneur has a chance to feel one day.

### Support is Everything
It does not matter how awesome your product looks, how nice the video is, or how modern the codebase is. If you can not support your software, your customers will know and your sales will stagnate. After you launch, you will spend most of your time doing support. Find a way to do support as efficiently as possible. I did not do this. I used email for support and **email does not scale well for support**. You will quickly find yourself in email conversations that span forty to fifty threads with a single potential or current customer.

Not only will customers not read the marketing material on your website, you will find yourself answering the same question over and over. It is so important to find a way to provide quality support efficiently that I rank it as the highest item on this list. If you are a one-person operation, you will get burnt out quickly on doing support. Kwolla averaged about 5000 unique views a month and I was quickly burnt out on support alone; I can't imagine what would happen if I had ten times the number of visitors.

Selling a piece of software built on PHP means you will deal with some people who just are not developers and have no business running a website. Especially when your software is a "social network in a box". You will be in a constant battle with the worlds worst shared hosting services as your customers buy your product and then can not install it on their $3.99 a month "unlimited" service. It was an influencing decision to [retire from PHP](/entry/i-m-retiring-from-php.html).

### Say "No"
You have to say "No" to your potential and current customers. Potential customers will bait you with, "I will buy your product if you add Feature X" and current customers will claim, "I really need Feature Y for my idea to work, when can you implement it?". It is great to always listen to your customers, and if you see a trend with feature requests, you will want to consider adding them to your development backlog. This is your software, and you should be the ultimate driving force in what features you want to add.

### Price does not matter
Joel Spolsky wrote an in depth and eye opening article [on pricing your software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html). The basic conclusion is there is no exact science in how to price your software. One truism though is that price generally does not matter. I made the most sales with Kwolla at $79 than I did when it was $9.99 (I sold **zero** copies at $9.99). When you are anxiously debating if your software should be $149 or $179, start with $179.

### Your product will be pirated
And it will be pirated almost immediately. Someone will buy a copy and "null" it. Or you will give a promo copy away for free and the unscrupulous user will upload it to the pirate sites. Your efforts to counteract this are useless. Try to find a way to convert those free downloaders to paying customers. However, be sure not to provide free support to someone who has not paid.

### Upsell services
No one knows your software better than you do (hopefully). Charge (a lot) for services. Installation help and premium support were two of the largest money makers for Kwolla. If someone **really** wants a new feature, charge them to build it, and then release it into your products next version.

### Communicate clearly with customers
I never used any CRM software to track potential and current customers. Set up a cheap (or free) Mailchimp account and create a list of potential customers and a list of current customers. Send them out periodic emails about your software's development status and when new versions are available to download.

### Reinvest your money
Take the money earned and reinvest it into ways to grow your business: advertising, professional design work (it always stands out so much more than a cheap theme from ThemeForest), contract work, or support. For example, [BuySellAds](http://buysellads.com) will make your advertising dollars go much further than AdWords.

### Selling software hard
As amazing as you think your product is, convincing someone else the same thing is very hard to do. It is incredibly gratifying to make a sell, and having a website that handles the full process for you is essential.

### Final Steps
I am no longer hacking on Kwolla in its current state. While I am moving away from doing only PHP work, the shopping cart software behind kwolla.com is well written and solid code. I am in the process of converting it to a SaaS and downloadable product so you too can easily sell your software or digital products online. Sign up for my newsletter to hear more about that when I am ready to release a beta.

### Next Up: Marketing
My next article will discuss how I transitioned from a programmer to a marketer and what I did to get my website visited.
