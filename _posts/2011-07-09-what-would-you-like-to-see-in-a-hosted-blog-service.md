Would you pay monthly for a dead simple to use blogging service? What would it take for you to get off Tumblr, Posterous, or Wordpress?

The features would be pretty basic:

+  All posts written in Markdown (with a WYSIWYG editor)
+  Will host images, but nothing fancier than a small gallery script and lightbox
+  Very basic and easy to read designs like the one used for this blog
+  Multiple authors
+  Categories (single level)
+  Archives
+  Mailchimp integration
+  Google Analytics integration
+  Social network integration
+  RSS (blog-wide and category specific)
+  yourname.ourblogservice.com with CNAME aliasing
+  Easy to export all of your data
+  Themeable with different themes available to install
+  1GB of storage space

Pricing would be similar as the Pinboard model: a 1 cent increase for each 10 people to register. Once you locked in your monthly rate, it would not increase. I would start the rates at $5/month and they would go up from there. Also, I dislike the idea that many monthly services are based entirely on the idea that you'll start paying for them and then never use them but neglect to cancel because it is difficult (think: gym memberships). Thus, your monthly fee would be waived if you didn't make a new post for the previous month.

Is this something that would be of interest to you? Let me know: <vic@brightmarch.com> or [@leftnode](https://twitter.com/leftnode)
