Today we launched the new version of [kwolla.com](http://kwolla.com). The new site has a number of updates, the largest being a fresh look and feel. We're hoping that by creating a very simple landing page, we can funnel potential customers to the product page, then cart page, and finally to make a purchase.

Below is a screenshot of the homepage of the old website. It worked well for us to start with, but having a very welcoming website is necessary for sales.

With this release of the website, we've also removed all coupon codes. We feel that $49.99 is a very fair price for Kwolla, especially considering you get free upgrades of all Kwolla releases and modules from Leftnode Software for life as part of the Initial Adopters program. This decision was also influenced by the [Discount Gambit by Jason Cohen](http://blog.asmartbear.com/discount-gambit.html).

We may add some promotions in the future, which is why the field is there, but for now, all promotions are disabled.

The code behind the new [kwolla.com](http://kwolla.com) was also rewritten from scratch. It uses our [PHP framework jolt](http://github.com/leftnode/jolt) for all of the input/output and database connectivity. It gave us a great opportunity to expand the framework and to use it an officially launched project. We plan on releasing the code behind the site soon so you can build your own shopping cart to sell digital goods.

Needless to say, we're very excited about the new website and would love your feedback.

**About Kwolla**: Kwolla is a new piece of social networking software where you can grow your own social network. Use it if you're a university and want to connect your students, a business and wants your employees communicating more, or a group of friends who want to talk about their favorite hobbies. It is on sale for $49.99 during the Initial Adopters program.
