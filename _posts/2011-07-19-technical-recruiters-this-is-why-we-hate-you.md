I got this email the other day from a recruiter from the company American CyberSystems (emphasis mine):

> Hi,
>
> Hope you are doing great!!!
>
> Reviewing your resume, I feel you would be a good match for our direct client and I expect this job will be of interest to you as well. Please send me your updated resume in MS Word format along with contact details, expected rate and the best time to speak with you. **If you are already working with our organization then you can apply for this position only if your current contract is finishing.**

Not only did he not bother to use my name in the salutation (probably proof it is a blast email to a list), he did not even bother to cross check their own internal database to see if I was already working with their company. Furthermore, he is asking for all sorts of information about me for a job he has no idea if I am qualified for or not.

Tech recruiters: *this is why we hate you*.
